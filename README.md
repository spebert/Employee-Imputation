# Employee-Imputation

This paper details an effective method for imputing missing values when the data is modeled as coming from a Multivariate Normal (MVN) population distribution. We then pool across those imputations to ﬁnd parameter estimates in a linear regression context. Then we use the MVN model to analyze data on university professors with the goal of answering various questions how about Job Performance and Tenure by conditioning for them. We conclude that the most important predictors of Job Performance are Age, Well-Being and IQ, whereas Tenure is signiﬁcantly affected by Age and Job Satisfaction.
